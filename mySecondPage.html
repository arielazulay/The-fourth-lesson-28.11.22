    <h1>Health</h1>

    <h2>Health</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Health is the level of functional or metabolic efficiency of a living
      organism. In humans, it is the ability of individuals or communities to
      adapt and self-manage when facing physical, mental, or social challenges.
      The most widely accepted definition of good health is that of the World
      Health Organization Constitution. It states: "health is a state of
      complete physical, mental and social well-being and is not merely the
      absence of disease or infirmity" (World Health Organization, 1946). In
      more recent years, this statement has been amplified to include the
      ability to lead a "socially and economically productive life." The WHO
      definition is not without criticism; mainly that it is much too broad. The
      most solid aspects of wellness that fit firmly in the realm of medicine
      are environmental health, nutrition, disease prevention, and public
      health. These matters can be investigated at length, and can assist in
      measuring well-being

    <h2>history</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The meaning of health has evolved over time. In keeping with the
      biomedical perspective, early definitions of health focused on the theme
      of the body's ability to function; health was seen as a state of normal
      function that could be disrupted from time to time by disease. An example
      of such a definition of health is: "a state characterized by anatomic,
      physiologic, and psychological integrity; ability to perform personally
      valued family, work, and community roles; ability to deal with physical,
      biological, psychological, and social stress".[3] Then, in 1948, in a
      radical departure from previous definitions, the World Health Organization
      (WHO) proposed a definition that aimed higher, linking health to
      well-being, in terms of "physical, mental, and social well-being, and not
      merely the absence of disease and infirmity".[4] Although this definition
      was welcomed by some as being innovative, it was also criticized for being
      vague and excessively broad and was not construed as measurable. For a
      long time, it was set aside as an impractical ideal, with most discussions
      of health returning to the practicality of the biomedical model.[5] <br />
      <br />
      Just as there was a shift from viewing disease as a state to thinking of
      it as a process, the same shift happened in definitions of health. Again,
      the WHO played a leading role when it fostered the development of the
      health promotion movement in the 1980s. This brought in a new conception
      of health, not as a state, but in dynamic terms of resiliency, in other
      words, as "a resource for living". In 1984, WHO revised the definition of
      health defined it as "the extent to which an individual or group is able
      to realize aspirations and satisfy needs and to change or cope with the
      environment. Health is a resource for everyday life, not the objective of
      living; it is a positive concept, emphasizing social and personal
      resources, as well as physical capacities."[6] Thus, health referred to
      the ability to maintain homeostasis and recover from adverse events.
      Mental, intellectual, emotional and social health referred to a person's
      ability to handle stress, to acquire skills, to maintain relationships,
      all of which form resources for resiliency and independent living.[5] This
      opens up many possibilities for health to be taught, strengthened and
      learned.

    <h2>Maintaining</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
      <h3>diet</h3>
      An important way to maintain one's personal health is to have a healthy diet. A healthy diet includes a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods that provide nutrients to the body. Such nutrients provide the body with energy and keep it running. Nutrients help build and strengthen bones, muscles, and tendons and also regulate body processes (i.e., blood pressure). Water is essential for growth, reproduction and good health. Macronutrients are consumed in relatively large quantities and include proteins, carbohydrates, and fats and fatty acids. Micronutrients – vitamins and minerals – are consumed in relatively smaller quantities, but are essential to body processes.[41] The food guide pyramid is a pyramid-shaped guide of healthy foods divided into sections. Each section shows the recommended intake for each food group (i.e., protein, fat, carbohydrates and sugars). Making healthy food choices can lower one's risk of heart disease and the risk of developing some types of cancer, and can help one maintain their weight within a healthy range.[42]

      The Mediterranean diet is commonly associated with health-promoting effects. This is sometimes attributed to the inclusion of bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds, isoprenoids and alkaloids.
      <h3>Exercise</h3>
      Physical exercise enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. It strengthens one's bones and muscles and improves the cardiovascular system. According to the National Institutes of Health, there are four types of exercise: endurance, strength, flexibility, and balance.[44] The CDC states that physical exercise can reduce the risks of heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, depression, and anxiety.[45] For the purpose of counteracting possible risks, it is often recommended to start physical exercise gradually as one goes. Participating in any exercising, whether it is housework, yardwork, walking or standing up when talking on the phone, is often thought to be better than none when it comes to health.

      <h3>Sleep</h3>
      Sleep is an essential component to maintaining health. In children, sleep is also vital for growth and development. Ongoing sleep deprivation has been linked to an increased risk for some chronic health problems. In addition, sleep deprivation has been shown to correlate with both increased susceptibility to illness and slower recovery times from illness.[47] In one study, people with chronic insufficient sleep, set as six hours of sleep a night or less, were found to be four times more likely to catch a cold compared to those who reported sleeping for seven hours or more a night.[48] Due to the role of sleep in regulating metabolism, insufficient sleep may also play a role in weight gain or, conversely, in impeding weight loss.[49] Additionally, in 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is the cancer research agency for the World Health Organization, declared that "shiftwork that involves circadian disruption is probably carcinogenic to humans," speaking to the dangers of long-term nighttime work due to its intrusion on sleep.[50] In 2015, the National Sleep Foundation released updated recommendations for sleep duration requirements based on age, and concluded that "Individuals who habitually sleep outside the normal range may be exhibiting signs or symptoms of serious health problems or, if done volitionally, may be compromising their health and well-being."[51]
